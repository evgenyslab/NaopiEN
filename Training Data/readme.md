This folder contains the training data from experiments collected with Nao using
main.py.

All the data is combined into arff files for weka classification. The inputs were shifted to be >0.

The file 'combined3p.arff' should contain all training data collected.
The file 'iris.arff' is a reference file for properly correlated data. It does not relate to any of the experiments conducted.

The folder Original contains the orignal, smaller set of training data.

The folder Mixed Data contains different combinations of the full training data with one or two emotions removed form the set to check for classification fits.
