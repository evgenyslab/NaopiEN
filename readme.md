NaopiEN

This program is a fork of FSM_Emotions.

The majority of code changes are in main.py with the addition of taskQuestions.py

To run the program, make sure the nao is on the same wireless network as the host computer, and simply run main.py.

Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed, specifically the Nao libraries for alberbaan.
